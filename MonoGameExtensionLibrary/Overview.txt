StateMachine and State are useful in the creation of State Machines

StateMachine keeps track of a Dictionary of States that is accessible by using an enumerator
State keeps track of the state's enumerator representation and information on the conditions for the next state and what to do upon entering the next state


Text Constructor and Text  (WIP)

Text Constructor refers to a robust constructor class that is designed to create text classes
Text structs are used to quickly create and write Text in an efficient manner using SpriteBatches


IShape, Circ, and Rect

IPositionable2d describes something with a X, Y position
IBoundable2d inherits from IPositionable2d, but keeps track of a Rectangle to describes the AABB of an object
IShape2d is an interface that inherits from IBoundable2d, but add checks for whether it contains a point or intersects another Ishape2d
doublesided in Ishape2d refers to whether the IShape2d instance should check the other Ishape2d in the case of it not have an intersection method
IShape2d<Shape> Where Shape:Ishape2d is an alternate version of IShape2d that impliments IEquatable, which adds an Equals() function, as well as a check against other of the same shape

Rect is a struct inherited from Ishape2d<Rect> that describes a rectangle made of floats
Circ is a struct inherited from Ishape2d<Circ> that describes a Circ made of floats

Collider

A Collider is a class that adds some special functionality to a shape, most notibly an event system and an optimization to checking for collisions
A Collider can have functions subscribe to it's events: OnCollisionEnter, OnCollisionStay, OnCollisionExit that it will call when it does on of the things
Using a collider rather than a shape allows for more control of the ways a collider can interact with other colliders

GameObject

A Gameobject describes the combination of a Collider with a Drawable component, Game objects add two new events: Draw and Update
The Draw Event will be called whenever a gameobject is drawn and the same for the Update Event
Gameobjects provide the bare minimum for creating engaging objects in the world in a singular class.
